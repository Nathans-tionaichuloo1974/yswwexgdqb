wow just walked out of the theater, the ugly stepsister, what a ride. popcorn everywhere, i'm basically a human popcorn ball now. back is killing me from those chairs, worse than my office. how does anyone make it through that in one piece? like somehow two hours of plot slouched in agony. 

> the theater was so noisy, like a rainforest full of chattering parrots, and folks kept texting, the glow turning faces into blue ghosts. i remember the opening scene with mousy ella--that's it right? protagonist types always get so much more face time, it's like when my ferrets try to hog all the food at once. 

and the dance scene, oh lord, it had the rhythm of a as a three-legged dog sprinting after a squirrel. the choreography was like, conflict between my cats, graceful but threatening chaos. 

ever realize how the floor gets all sticky by the end, sticking like the plot stuck to the classic cinderella tale? but also different, a bit? the ugly stepsister had grit, some bite. not just a sob story. she was a hedgehog, prickly and rolling through. ugh got popcorn in my keyboard. 

the part where she stood up at the royal ball gave me goosebumps, like when i find out how much vaccines cost--surprising but necessary. and the prince? vanilla pudding, man. but aren't they always? 

this might be that movie you download when you're sick at home, feverish--watch the movie in delirium, maybe it even makes sense then? lol, asked my colleague for a link but can't remember who. 

connections kinda blurred, my brain arranging words like tetris pieces. can't piece back the cat dialog trying to remember if i locked my car while on the first scene. 

definitely not what i expected but hey, unpredictability’s sometimes the name of the game like diagnosing pike in a fish tank. erratic, maybe that's its charm? 

```python
for animal in range(magic_kingdom):
    if species == frog:
        become_prince()
    elif type(animal) == Slipper:
        continue_search()
```
